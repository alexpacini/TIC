## assignment01_mutinfo
    
> A Matlab/ __Octave__ function that, given the transition matrix P and the probability vector for the input symbols Px, returns the mutual information I(X;Y).
It is provided with some tests that show the mutual information for some channels with different sets of P and Px and outputs the 3D surface plots.

## assignment02_apcap_numint

> A Matlab/ __Octave__ script to plot a comparison for the capacity of the Antipodal unquantized channel, the AWGN unquantized channel and the Antipodal 2-Level quantized channel.  
There is also a function for calculating the definite numerical integrals with different algorithms.

## assignment03_noisyap2L

> A Matlab/ __Octave__ script to simulate a noisy antipodal 2 level transmission.

## assignment04_noisyap2LHamm

> A Matlab/ __Octave__ script that simulates an antipodal 2-level transmission 
> over an AWGN channel using the Hamming block code.
